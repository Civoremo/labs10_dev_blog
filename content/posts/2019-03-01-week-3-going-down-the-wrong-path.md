  Knowing when to abandon an idea and starting from scratch is an underrated
  concept. While it may seem crazy to have spent hours or even days on a concept
  to only later realize that it is not feasible; using the knowledge one has
  acquired during that time can lead to a smoother path forward.

## Labs 10 Team Home 2 Week Three Experience

- - -

What a week, what a week. You never know what you don't know until you know. Another week has gone by and the project is progressing. We have implemented all the features that we need although some are working better than others. In particular the initial Drag and Drop feature we started out with ended up being the incorrect approach to the solution. After countless hours molding the DnD, fixing one bug to only reveal several others we as a team have come to the conclusion that we need a different implementation. 

The team has been hard at work implementing the various front end features, such as the various modals and activity timelines, responsiveness and styling. I was impressed by all the hard work that Bondor, Eileen and Kai have put in and the results show it.

We now have the ability to add Folders, Documents, edit and update either. A user can leave a comment on a particular document, they can like a comment on that document and they have the ablity to subscribe to particular document to receive text messages or emails whenever someone contributes to the conversation.
