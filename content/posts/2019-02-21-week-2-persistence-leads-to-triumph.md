## Labs 10 Team Home 2 Week Two Experience

- - -

Let me start of by saying that I could not have joined a better team. A fun dynamic group that appears to enjoy spending time together working on difficult tasks; we spend upwards of 10 hours or more a day together on conference video as we work on code. We all tend to agree that we don't necessarily need to pair program to get things done but enjoy having someone around to think things through as we work on our individual tasks.This has been especially helpful as we encountered an issue with our deployed front end. 

The previous week our team spend a good amount of time going through the documentation of the project and the code base to understand the intricacies of the project. After making our various deployments  for the back end and the front end; all things seemed to be up and running and working properly. We focused our attention to setting up local work environments and begin tackling features. Soon after that we noticed that while our local environment was working exactly as expected, our deployed front end had difficulty login in with Auth0. We kept receiving error code 400, which baffled many that attempted to help us resolve the issue.
