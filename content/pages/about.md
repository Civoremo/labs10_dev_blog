My name is Nedim Omerovic and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I joined Lambda School to pursue my passion for coding; thanks to Lambda I have had the pleasure to work with amazing developers and learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, SQL, GraphQL, MongoDB, Node, Express and much. I've started this blog to document some of the learning experience that Lambda has exposed me to.
